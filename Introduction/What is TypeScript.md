# What is TypeScript

Typscript is build on top of JavaScript. It is superset of JavaScript. It provide two major advantgaes.

-  The first one is that it transpiles TypeScript into JavaScript so the advanced ECMAScript features not available to all web browsers can be used by providing a polyfill. It acts as a combination of other static checkers combined with Babel

- The second advantage of TypeScript is that it can enforce static typing to catch potential issues earlier in the lifecycle of development. It reduces the need for some unit tests and can analyze the code to find runtime errors at design time
